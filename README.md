## Getting Started

You can get the latest code from
[here](https://github.com/vmbdev/littleterrarium-material/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
or through Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vmbdev/littleterrarium-material.git
```

### Prerequisites

Little Terrarium Material requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later
installed on your system.

LT Material also requires
[Little Terrarium Backend](https://github.com/vmbdev/littleterrarium-backend)
to make it work.

### Installation

First of all, we need to install its dependencies. Open a terminal and get to
the directory where it's installed and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Setup

In the **src** directory, edit **config.ts** if necessary. Available ptions
are:

- **bakckendUrlDevelopment**: The URL of the backend when running in a
development environment.
- **bakckendUrlProduction**: The URL of the backend when running in production.
- **frontendUrlDevelopment**: The URL of the frontend when running in
development.
- **frontendUrlDevelopment**: The URL of the frontend when running in
production.
- **endpoint**: In the backend URL, where to make the API calls.
- **theme**: Default theme when first accesed.
- **availableThemes**: List of available themes.
- **defaultLang**: Default language defined by id ('en', 'es', 'fr'...).
- **availableLangs**: List of available languages defined as LangDefinition[]
in Transloco, this is, an array of { id, label } where id is the locale and the
name of the translation file in /assets/i18n, and label is the name of the
language (i.e. "Espa√±ol", "English", "British English"...).

## Deployment

To serve the UI locally, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

To build Little Terrarium Web with its translations, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will produce a **dist** folder with the static content.

### Build served as web through Backend

Place the **dist** folder in the LT backend root directory and when started, it
will detect the content and serve it in the base URL.

### Build for Android/iOS

To build the mobile version we'll use Capacitor and Xcode/Android Studio. First
we'll start by adding support for the platforms that we'll build to:

```bash
npx cap add android
```

```bash
npx cap add ios
```

Then we'll compile the assets (icons, splash screen) for our application:

```bash
npx capacitor-assets generate
```

After building our application, we have to sync the Angular build with the
Capacitor platforms:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

Then we can run it in our emulator (or devices, if configured) with:

```bash
npx cap run <platform>
```

Or build it with Xcode/Android Studio with:

```bash
npx cap open <platform>
```
